# Green Iron Superpower
A Green Iron Plan for Australia - The SuperPower Institute
Founded in 2023 by economist Ross Garnaut and public
policy expert Rod Sims, The Superpower Institute is a
not-for-profit organisation dedicated to helping Australia
seize the extraordinary economic opportunities of the
post-carbon world.

The Institute’s focus is on developing the policy settings,
market incentives and practical knowledge necessary
for Australia to become a major exporter of renewable
energy and green industrial products. By leveraging the
nation’s comparative advantage, the Institute aims to
elevate Australia’s economic and climate ambition and
secure its place as a leader in a decarbonised global
economy.
